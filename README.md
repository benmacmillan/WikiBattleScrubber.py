# Wikipedia Battle Scraper
A basic web scraper that pulls some of the sidebar battle information for historic battle pages on Wikipedia. 
There are currently two versions of the project for command line use or just for directly editing the URL into my old script. 

- Requires BeautifulSoup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

## WikiBattleScraper.py
The First version of the script, it will pull the information from the URL that is listed directly in the script.

## cl_scraper.py
A version which can be used in command line, set the URL with -url and then the Wikipedia url. 
Example: **cl_scraper.py -url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thymbra**
